![Wonolo Frontend Draft React](https://github.com/ke4tri/Images/blob/master/NewWonolo.JPG?raw=true)

## Had an interview with Wonolo.com. They were looking for developers to refactor their current site into React.js. They decided not to move to Nashville at the time but prior to the interview I went through and created a landing page wrapped in React.js so I could show them. 

## [Link to DEMO](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6547222422616059904)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
